BeamMeUpScotty is a 2D structural analysis tool developed in Python. It enables users to model, analyze, and visualize trusses, beams, and frames using finite element methods. The project meant for practicing finite element methods and numerical methods.

## Features
### Structural Analysis Capabilities
2D Analysis of truss and beam structures

Material Properties: Define Young's modulus, cross-sectional area, and moment of inertia for each element.

Boundary Conditions: Apply various support types (fixed, roller, pinned) and external loads (point loads, distributed loads, moments).

Assembles global stiffness matrices, applies input boundary conditions, and solves for nodal displacements.

## Visualization
Structure Plotting: Visualize undeformed and deformed structures.

Force Diagrams: Generate shear force and bending moment diagrams for beams and frames.

Interactive Interface: User-friendly interface for model creation and result interpretation.

## Planned Features
Solver for beams with varied cross sections
GUI
Result export to .csv / .pdf
