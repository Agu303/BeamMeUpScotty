BeamMeUpScotty is a 2D structural analysis tool developed in Python. It enables users to model, analyze, and visualize **trusses** and **beams**.

## Features

### Structural Analysis Capabilities

- **2D Analysis of Truss and Beam Structures**:  
  Analyze trusses (axial force only) and Euler-Bernoulli beams (bending and shear). 

- **Material Properties**:  
  Define Young's modulus, cross-sectional area, and moment of inertia for each element.

- **Boundary Conditions**:  
  Apply various support types (fixed, roller, pinned) and external loads (point loads, distributed loads, moments).

- **Numerical Approximation Solver**:  
  Assembles global stiffness matrices, applies input boundary conditions, and solves for nodal displacements using **numerical methods**.

### Visualization

- **Structure Plotting**:  
  Visualize undeformed and deformed structures.

- **Force Diagrams**:  
  Generate shear force and bending moment diagrams for beams and frames.

- **Interactive Interface**:  
  User-friendly interface for model creation and result interpretation.

## Planned Features

- **Solver for Beams with Varied Cross Sections**  
  Enhance beam analysis to handle beams with varying cross-sections and complex loading.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>  # Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL
    cd BeamMeUpScotty
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Tkinter is usually included with Python. If not, you may need to install it separately (e.g., `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` on Debian/Ubuntu).
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the application, navigate to the project directory and execute the `gui.py` script:

```bash
python gui.py
```

### Basic Workflow:

1.  **Add Nodes**: Select "Add Node" mode and click on the canvas to place nodes.
2.  **Add Elements**: Select "Add Element" mode. 
    *   Click on an existing node to start an element.
    *   Click on another existing node to finish the element, or click on an existing element to split it and connect to the new node.
3.  **Define Material & Section**: 
    *   Use the "Material & Cross-Section" panel to define material properties (Young's Modulus E) and section properties (Area A, Moment of Inertia I).
    *   Click "Add New Properties" to create custom materials/sections or select from predefined ones.
    *   Select an element from the dropdown and click "Apply to Selected Element" or "Apply to All Elements".
    *   To model truss behavior, define a beam element with a Moment of Inertia (`I`) of zero or near-zero.
4.  **Apply Loads**: 
    *   Select a node in the "Node Load" section.
    *   Enter Fx, Fy, and/or Moment values (units are N and NÂ·m by default, can be changed).
    *   Click "Add/Update Load".
5.  **Apply Boundary Conditions (Supports)**:
    *   Select a node in the "Boundary Conditions" section.
    *   Choose a BC type (Fixed, Pinned, Roller-X, Roller-Y, or Custom).
    *   Click "Apply Boundary Condition".
6.  **Solve**: Click the "Solve" button in the "Results" section.
7.  **View Results**:
    *   Click "Plot Deformed" to see the deformed shape.
    *   Click "Identify Zero-Force Members" to highlight them (for truss-like structures).
    *   Export a PDF report using the "Export PDF" button. The report includes input data, undeformed/deformed plots, reactions, axial forces, and SFD/BMD for beam-like elements.

### Controls:

*   **Mouse Wheel**: Scroll the control panel.
*   **Right-Click + Drag on Plot**: Pan the view.
*   **Middle-Click on Plot (during element creation)**: Cancel the current element placement.
*   **Zoom Buttons**: Zoom in/out or reset the plot view.
*   **Undo/Redo**: Revert or reapply recent actions.

## Requirements

The application requires Python 3 and the following libraries:

*   **NumPy**: For numerical operations (`pip install numpy`).
*   **SciPy**: For solving linear systems (`pip install scipy`).
*   **Matplotlib**: For plotting structures and results (`pip install matplotlib`).
*   **Tkinter**: For the graphical user interface (usually included with Python standard library. If not, installation depends on your OS, e.g., `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` for Debian/Ubuntu).

A `requirements.txt` file is provided for easy installation of Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
