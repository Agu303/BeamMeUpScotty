    "Main focus on:\n",
    "- Accuracy: Validated and optimized with analytical methods whenver possible.  Numerical methods will be tested against well-known analytical methods (Euler-Bernoulli Method, Stiffness Method, Castiglian Method, etc.) where applicable.\n",

    "### What are analytical methods in structural mechanics?\n",
    "~ Analytical methods like Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and Castigliano's theorems use closed-form mathematical equations derived from differential equations or energy methods. These are great for quick, accurate results in **simple** systems (e.g., statically determinate, single-span, uniform loading, idealized, linear behavior during elastic deformation)."
